Collection of useful scripts for interacting with GitHub
========================================================

- `pr_send` - open a PR from your current branch
  (it will open a temporary editor instance for editing the PR description)
- `pr_push` - push to any PR
- `merge_stable` - merge `upstream/stable` into `upstream/master` and submit a PR
- `pr_split` (alpha) - will automatically split a PR into multiple PRs and submit these (one PR for each file)

How to use
----------

Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wilzbach/git-tools
```

And then put it in your path:

```sh
export PATH="$(pwd)/git-tools:$PATH"
```

Optional dependencies
---------------------

- [`hub`](https://github.com/github/hub) - allows to directly open the PR
- `upstream` remote endpoint

Most of these scripts need an `upstream` endpoint to work correctly.
Set it e.g. by:

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:dlang/phobos.git
```

Clone any PR
------------

### Checkout a single PR

Set the `pr` alias once for your global `.gitconfig`:

```shell
git config --global alias.pr '!f() { git fetch -fu ${2:-$(git remote |grep ^upstream || echo origin)} refs/pull/$1/head:pr/$1 && git checkout pr/$1; }; f'
```

Now fetch and checkout a single PR:

```shell
git pr 123
```

### Fetch all PRs

Alternatively you can also add an additional `fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*`
line in your `.git/config` file:

```shell
[remote "upstream"]
	url = git@github.com:dlang/phobos.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*
```

Now fetch `upstream` as usual:

```shell
git fetch upstream
```

And switch to any PR:

```
git checkout pr/123
```

`pr_send` - open a PR from your current branch
----------------------------------------------

```bash
git checkout -b my-fancy-branch
# do some work
pr_send
```

- it will open a temporary editor instance for editing the PR description
- opens a new PR against `upstream/master` or `origin/master`

`pr_push` - push to any PR
--------------------------

```bash
git pr 123
# do some work
pr_push
```

__Warning__: This tool with force-push to the PR. Be careful. You have been warned.

`merge_stable` - merge `upstream/stable` into `upstream/master`
---------------------------------------------------------------

- execute within the current git repo or pass the git repository as first argument

```bash
merge_stable
```

`pr_split`: Submitting step-by-step
-----------------------------------

The first command will show you all the files that are considered as changes:

```sh
pr_split
```

Without any argument it will _simulate_ the split and don't do any action:

```
Adding: public/content/de/welcome/links-documentation.md
Adding: public/content/de/welcome/run-d-program-locally.md
Simulation was run. Now use -f/--force to apply.
```

Accordingly to submit these files to Github, use `-f` or `--force`:

```sh
pr_split -f
```

By default the tool will only process one PR per run, however once you are familiar
with the tool you can enable the batch mode with `-a` or `--all`.

```sh
pr_split -f --all
```

_Warning_:  If you run this script for the first time, make a copy of your work beforehand.

### Usage with an existing commit or branch

#### A) With a custom branch

Change to your master branch and checkout all changes from your branch:

```
git checkout master
git checkout my-fancy-branch -- .
```

#### B) With an commit on `master`

Simply reset your changes to the ones of the `upstream` branch.
Warning: this will remove your new commits, but not the changes.

```
git reset --soft upstream/master
```

If you haven't an `upstream` remote, you can also try to remove the commits directly.
For example to remove one commit, but keep the changes run:

```
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### Options

#### `-p`, `--prefix`

To categorize the PRs the `-p` or `--prefix` flag can be given. It will
be prefixed before every PR and commit message. Example:

```sh
pr_split -p "[german]"
```

#### `-m`, `--message`

Similar to `-p`, but applied only for the git commit message.
It comes after the prefix, but before the file name.

```sh
pr_split -m "My fancy git commit message"
```

#### `-b`, `--branchprefix`

Allows to use a prefix before the generated branches, e.g.

```sh
pr_split -b "run_spec_"
```

File paths will use underscores instead of slashes.

#### `--basename`

For all added files, only use their `basename` for the branch name and
git commit message.
By default, the path within the git directory is used, but with slashes
translated to underscores. Example

- file: `foo/bar/duck.md`
- default branch name: `foo_bar_duck`
- `--basename` branch name: `duck`

Be careful with this option.
Multiple files with the same filename will lead to errors.

#### `-f`, `--force`

Switch from the simulation mode and do the actions in the real world.

#### `-a`, `--all`

Don't stop after sending one PR, send all in one run.

### Full example

#### 1) Simulation

```sh
pr_split -m 'Allow examples of the D spec to be runnable:' -b "run_spec_" -p "[run-spec]"
```

#### 2) Step by step

```sh
pr_split -m 'Allow examples of the D spec to be runnable:' -b "run_spec_" -p "[run-spec]" -f
```

After one or two PRs, you can use `--all` to submit all remaining files.
